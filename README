This library provides a Haskell interface to the RE2 regular expression library,
available from:

    http://code.google.com/p/re2/

It also implements a plain C API for a subset of RE2.  This wrapping layer
could be useful on its own.


To build the documentation, run

  $ cabal configure && cabal haddock --hyperlink-source

This will produce HTML documentation under dist/doc/html/re2
